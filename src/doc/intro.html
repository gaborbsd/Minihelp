<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Minihelp is a small help viewer utility that allows you building a
HTML-based documentation. The concept is similar to that of JavaHelp and
Oracle Help, however Minihelp provides only the most essential functionality
needed for such help systems. JavaHelp is an old and unmaintained library.
It is feature-richer than Minihelp and allows more customizations but the
support of these makes its codebase much bigger. Minihelp is kept to be tiny.
In most applications, the provided features are just fine and in case
customizations are needed, developers that rely on it are encouraged to
modify the code themselves. On the other hand, Oracle Help is still under
development and maintenance by Oracle but using it requires huge libraries.
Furthermore, it is not open-source, what may prevent open source projects
from using it. Minihelp is licensed under the
<a href="license.html">2-clause BSD license</a>.</p>
