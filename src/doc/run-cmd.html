<h1>Invoking Minihelp from the Command Line</h1>
<p>The main class of the application is <tt>org.kovesdan.minihelp.MiniHelpViewer</tt>,
and it takes a single argument, the path of the configuration file. When the class
is invoked, the configuration file is parsed, the Swing Look and Feel is set to the
System Look and Feel, and the help window is initialized and displayed from the
AWT event dispatch thread. When invoked from command-line, the index tab is only
shown if there are index terms defined in the configuration file. The search tab is
always shown.</p>
