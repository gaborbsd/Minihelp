<h1>Invoking Minihelp Programmatically</h1>
<p>Invoking the Minihelp involves to steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The XML configuration file must be read and parsed. This can be
done with any of the two static methods in <tt>org.kovesdan.minihelp.xml.ConfigurationReader</tt>:</p>

<p><tt>public static Configuration parseConfiguration(File file) throws JAXBException</tt></p>

<p><tt>public static Configuration parseConfiguration(Path path) throws JAXBException</tt></p>

<p>If the XML file is well-formed and valid, a properly initialized <tt>Configuration</tt> object is
returned. Otherwise, a <tt>JAXBException</tt> is thrown.</p></li>

<li><p>The help window is <tt>org.kovesdan.minihelp.MiniHelp</tt>, a subclass of <tt>JFrame</tt>. After
instantiating the window, <tt>setVisible(true)</tt> has to be called. There are two constructors
that can be used. The first one takes a <tt>Configuration</tt> object and an URI that will serve
as a base <tt>URI</tt>, where documents are looked for. The second one takes two additional
boolean parameters: whether to show the index and the search tabs. By default, the index
tab is shown if there are index terms defined in the configuration and the search 
tab is always shown unconditionally.</p>

<p><tt>public MiniHelp(Configuration configuration, URI baseUri) throws HeadlessException</tt></p>

<p><tt>public MiniHelp(Configuration configuration, URI baseUri, boolean showIndexTab, boolean showSearchTab) throws HeadlessException</tt></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, <tt>org.kovesdan.minihelp.MiniHelpViewer</tt> has a <tt>static void main(String[])</tt>
method that is used when running from the command-line. It takes the path of the configuration
file as the first argument, sets the Swing Look and Feel to the system settings and
properly initializes the help window from the event dispatching thread. It may also be called
programmatically as a shorthand for these tasks.</p>
